# Find the square root of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the square root of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Assign number_iters = 100 in the function to perform 100 iteratios.
3. Set i = 0.
4. Calculate  number = 0.5 * (number + a / number) for 100 iterations.
5. Return number

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the square root for the given number(newton's method) using function.
Developed by: T Mounish
RegisterNumber:23002806
n=int(input())
approx=0.5*n
for i in range(1,10):
   a=0.5*(approx+n/approx)
   approx=a
print("Square root of the number:",a)  
*/
```

## Output:
![square](https://github.com/MounishT/Square-root-of-a-number/assets/138955798/f698a4c4-4a53-4751-adb9-2b47ea4cc345)



## Result:
Thus the program to find the square root for the given number(newton's method) using function is written and verified using python programming.
